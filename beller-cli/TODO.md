# TODOs

This is a non-exhaustive list of things that likely need to be implemented for this tool to be widely useful.
These are meant to represent the "big rocks" that need to be tackled before a "1.0" release. There may be smaller
`TODO` items listed inline in the code, that are not as critical.

These items are listed in no particular order.

- [ ] Add an "interactive" mode where the user is prompted for each required value
- [x] Support `p256` curve when generating private keys
- [ ] Support using refresh tokens where possible
- [ ] Support setting the PDS in a config file so it does not have to be repeated for every command
- [ ] Support PEM format for generating/loading keys?
